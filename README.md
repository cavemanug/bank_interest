# bank_interest
calculates bank interest

I was able to write functions and call them properly. I was also able to reuse code from the previous project to help with the display.

The code could be enhanced by cleaning up the main function making it more efficient and easier to read.

The code that I found most challenging to write was the display. I felt that there could have been a function to use to make the code seem less cluttered and easier to read. I didn't really overcome this challeng but instead decided to use seemingly cluttered code just to ensure the code was fully functional.

The skills from the project that will be transferable are the ability to write functional code. Debugging code that has been written by yourself is also helpful.

The program seems very basic so it should be easily maintainable. The readability of the program stems mostly from the notes in the program stating what each part of the code should be accomplishing.
